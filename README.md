## Tech Stack
I have used the following languages to build this portfolio:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3

and have used Netlify and Github to deploy.

In addition, Canva was used to create the images and tiles for Projects and Blog.

## Sitemap
The website has 4 pages, Home, Projects, Blog and Contact, as well as a logo that allows the user to go back to homepage.
These all have social medias on the footer

## Problems faces and further understanding
Acknowledging problems is important and what I would do again, this would involve further understanding of media queries and the responsiveness - this will be something I will be educating myself on.
